# BTC Node API

This is a Node.js project that provides a web API for interacting with a local Bitcoin node. It includes functionalities to retrieve balances of Bitcoin addresses and potentially other features like fetching price feeds.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the BTC Node API project on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/btc-node-api.git
   cd btc-node-api
   ```

2. **Create a `.env` file:**

   Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add the following content:

   ```plaintext
   BTC_STARTER_ADDRESS=your_starter_address
   BTC_HOTWALLET=your_hotwallet_address
   CURRENT_BTC_PRICE=initial_price
   ```

   Replace the placeholders with your actual Bitcoin addresses and price.

3. **Build and run Docker containers:**

   Open a terminal in the project directory and run:

   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

   This will start the BTC Node API and a local Bitcoin node.

4. **Access the API:**

   - Balances: [http://localhost:3000/balances](http://localhost:3000/balances)

## Usage

- The `/balances` endpoint retrieves balances for BTC_STARTER_ADDRESS and BTC_HOTWALLET addresses from the local Bitcoin node.
- More routes for additional functionalities can be added to the `server.js` file.
